# PGP Tool
PGP Tool is a Java-based desktop GUI application for easy PGP decryption/encryption of files and text.

It will be especially useful for those who tend to store sensitive information on their computer and sometimes sync this to google drive, drop box, etc.. And don't want this information to be stored in un-encrypted state.

PGP software which is already exists doesn't seem to support this use case in a user-friendly way. It requires to perform many manual operations which is quite annoying. Software supposed to automate things and not the other way around.

This application requires minimal number of user actions.
